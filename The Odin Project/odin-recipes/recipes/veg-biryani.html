    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Hyderabadi Veg Biryani is a fragrant, layered dum-style rice dish where spiced vegetables and
        saffron-infused basmati rice are slow-cooked together to create a rich, aromatic meal.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups basmati rice, washed and soaked 30–45 minutes</li>
        <li>2 cups mixed vegetables (carrot, peas, beans, cauliflower, potato) — chopped</li>
        <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced (for frying)</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup curd (yogurt)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>2–3 green chillies, slit</li>
        <li>Handful fresh mint leaves and coriander leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>A pinch of saffron soaked in 2 tbsp warm milk</li>
        <li>2–3 tbsp ghee (or butter) + 2 tbsp oil</li>
        <li>2 tbsp fried cashews & raisins (optional)</li>
        <li>Whole spices: 2 bay leaves, 1" cinnamon stick, 4 cloves, 4 green cardamom, 2 black cardamom (optional)</li>
        <li>Spice powders: 1 tsp red chilli powder, 1 tsp garam masala, 1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
        <li>Salt to taste, juice of 1/2 lemon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Wash and soak basmati rice for 30–45 minutes. Par-cook the rice in boiling water with a little salt and whole spices until 70% done; drain and set aside.</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a wide, heavy-bottomed pan. Fry sliced onions until golden brown and crisp (store a handful for garnish); remove and set aside.</li>
      <li>In the same pan, add ghee and a few whole spices. Sauté ginger-garlic paste and green chillies until the raw aroma disappears.</li>
      <li>Add chopped tomatoes and cook until soft. Mix in curd, turmeric, red chilli powder, garam masala, and salt; cook until oil separates from the masala.</li>
      <li>Add the mixed vegetables, a little water if needed, cover and cook until vegetables are just tender but not mushy. Stir in chopped mint and coriander, lemon juice, and fried nuts/raisins if using.</li>
      <li>In a heavy-bottom pot (or same pan wiped clean), start layering: spread half of the vegetable masala, then half of the par-cooked rice. Sprinkle some fried onions, mint, coriander, garam masala, and a few drops of saffron milk. Repeat with the remaining masala and rice for a second layer.</li>
      <li>Seal the pot tightly with a lid (or dough) and cook on very low heat (dum) for 20–25 minutes. Alternatively, place the pot on a tava/griddle and keep it on low heat to avoid burning the base.</li>
      <li>Turn off heat, let rest for 5–10 minutes. Gently fluff the rice with a fork, garnish with remaining fried onions and a drizzle of ghee, and serve hot with raita and mirchi ka salan or salad.</li>
    </ol>
